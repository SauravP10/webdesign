            <h2>What is HCI?</h2>
            <p>Human computer interaction is the study design, evaluation, and implementation of interactive computing systems for human use and the major phenomena surrounding them. Consist of three parts: the person, the computer, the way they work together

            <h2>What is an User Interface</h2>
            <p>User interface design refers to graphical user interfaces and other forms that
           designers build in software to create interfaces for computerized devices that users  
           find easy to use and pleasurable.

            <h2>What makes a Good User Interface?</h2>
            <p>
              User interface should be enjoyable, they should communicate brand values. Good    
            design is emotional design that evokes emotion which results in experiences. Users      
            judge designs quickly and care about usability and likeability. People care about   
            getting their task done easily and with minimum effort.

            <h2>What does your design need to take into account?</h2>
            <p>
              Consider the fact that users judge designs quickly and take into account usability and likeability
              <br>
              Process of interaction design:
              <br>1.  Identifying needs and requirements
              <br>2.  Developing designs that fulfill those requirements
              <br>3.  Building interactive products of the design so that they can be used
              <br>4.  Evaluate the ‘building’ process throughout

            <h2>Usability Goals</h2>
            <p>
              Effectiveness:
              <br>
              The system needs to be effective at what it is meant to do
            </p>
            <p>
              Efficiency:
              <br>
              Is the interactive product efficient in what it does?
            </p>
            <p>
              Safety:
              <br>
              Is the interactive product safe to use? This involves two
              aspects; external and internal safety. External safety is concerned
              with the surrounding environment of the interactive product.
              Hazardous objects should not be near the product.
              The internal aspect of the safety goal is to make sure that the
              users are safe in a way that if they make a mistake they 
              can easily ‘re-do’ this click and their
              work/progress is not lost or deleted.
            </p>
            <p>
              Utility:
              <br>
              This goal aims to provide the user with the correct functionality a system can offer.
            </p>
            <p>
              Learnability:
              <br>
              Is the system easy to learn?
            </p>
            <p>
              Memorability:
              <br>
              Interface support is an essential
              part of any interactive product.
              The aim of it is to aid users remember how
              tasks/functions are carried out.
