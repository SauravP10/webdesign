            <p>Though there are many web browsers available, here's our short list of the best ones for any web dev. No matter your skill level or the type of site you need to make, these tools will be a huge help in building a great website. Keep reading to learn more.

            <h3>Firefox Developer Edition</h3>
            <div class="section-container-spacer">
              <img src="./assets/images/firefox.png" alt="" class="img-responsive reveal-content" data-action="zoom">
            </div>
            <p>
              On it’s own, Firefox is a pretty powerful browser. Deemed a lot faster than the average web browser, Firefox helps you to track down information and create stunning websites in a fraction of the time of something like Edge. 
            </p>
            <p>However, if you really want to get the next-level Firefox experience, then it’s worth upgrading to Firefox’s own developer edition. </p>
            <p>Like Google Chrome for Developers, Firefox’s Developer Edition comes built for the open web. </p>
            <p>Additionally, with Firefox Developer Edition, you get access to a next-generation CSS engine (written in RUST), an inactive CSS system that grays out CSS declarations that don’t impact the page, and more. There is also a host of “Firefox DevTools” to access. </p>
            <p>With your new browser, you can access a best-in-class JavaScript debugger, a Master CSS Grid, and various other features too. In fact, Firefox is the only browser that is specifically built with tools that help developers to build and design with their own CSS grid. These tools make it easier to visualize information, display area names, and preview transformations too.</p>

            <h3>Polypane</h3>
            <div class="section-container-spacer">
              <img src="./assets/images/polypane.png" alt="" class="img-responsive reveal-content" data-action="zoom">
            </div>
            <p>Finally, Polypane is a unique kind of browser, specifically designed for developers and designers. This browser is a cross-platform solution and Devtool that experts can use to develop, test, and debug sites as quickly as possible. </p>
            <p>Created to help developers and designers increase both the quality of their work and their productivity, Polypane is packed full of useful features. What’s more, it works with any code editor and technology stack. </p>
            <p>In an age where user experience is more important than ever, Polypane helps companies to build higher-quality websites through everything from WordPress, to Drupal and Angular. </p>
            <p>Because tools for developing and debugging are built into the browser already, you don’t have to worry about finding and adding extra extensions.</p>
            <p>For those who aren’t sure about using a new and proprietary browser experience, Polypane does come with a free trial. However, as with most specialist tools for web developers, you will need to pay if you want to continue accessing advanced features long-term. </p>
            <p>On the plus side, like Google Chrome’s developer edition, Polypane benefits from regular updates, so you know that you’re always going to be on the cutting edge of the web industry. </p>
            <p>What’s more, you can also access different packages depending on whether you’re using Polypane as an individual or an agency.</p>

            <h3>Google Chrome for Developers</h3>
            <div class="section-container-spacer">

            <p>Google Chrome stands out as one of the world’s most widely used browsers. </p>
            <p>Chrome has more than 58% of the market share, according to the latest estimates. With figures like that, it must have something special to offer. </p>
            <p>While Chrome might be particularly popular among everyday consumers, it also has something special to offer people in the web development and design world too. For instance, Google now has it’s own “Chrome browser for Developers” product. </p>
            <p>Created for the open web, Google Chrome for Developers helps professionals to design websites that are specifically optimized for the next version of the digital world. With Google Chrome, you can test cutting-edge APIs for web-based platforms in real-time.</p>
            <p>What’s more, Google Chrome is packed with endless tools and add-ons that you can implement into your browser. That includes PHP consoles for WordPress, screenshot tools for collecting web design inspiration, and even LastPass for password control. </p>
            <p>Not only do you have endless opportunities to get creative with Google Chrome, but you also have access to updates that happen on a weekly basis, so you know you’re always on the cutting edge. </p>
